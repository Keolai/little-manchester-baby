Small manchester baby simulator along with a simple assembler.

Simulator takes in text files containing the program binary (ex factor.txt).
Assembler supports all instructions and NUM, which allows for numbers to be inserted into the binary. The assembler also supports defining constants through #define.


**Usage**

Running the simulator:
```
./baby yourProgram.txt
```

Running the assembler:
```
./asm yourAssembly.txt yourOutput.txt
```
The output file can be left blank for usage of the default output path (output.txt).
